Turing Machine Sandbox collects minimal information necessary for gameplay:

- Account username and password (for authentication)
- Lobby participation and workshop uploads
- Logs (timestamps, actions) for debugging and moderation

This data is **not shared** with third parties and is stored only to maintain functionality.

Passwords are only used for authentication, however it is suggested that you use a safe password that you do not use for any other service.

Users may request deletion of their data at any time by contacting the developer.

Cookies are not used. Authentication tokens are stored locally by the client only.

WorkshopItems can be deleted by the user.
