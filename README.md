# Turing Sandbox Game
A game made with python using pygame to build and simulate turing machines

🔗Available for testing (OLD web build) at: [https://vascoapolinario.github.io/Turing-Sandbox-Game](https://vascoapolinario.github.io/Turing-Sandbox-Game/)

📦Latest version release at: [https://github.com/vascoapolinario/Turing-Sandbox-Game/releases/tag/0.4.0.0](https://github.com/vascoapolinario/Turing-Sandbox-Game/releases/tag/0.4.0.0)

## Game Preview
In this game preview you can see a level being solved, the level expects the user to build a turing machine that turns all zeros to ones and ones to zeros
