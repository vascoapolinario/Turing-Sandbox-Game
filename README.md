- Powered by SignalR and the TuringSandboxAPI, the multiplayer system allows real-time collaboration between players.

- Host and join lobbies directly from the in-game menu. Lobbies are automatically synchronized and updated live as players connect or leave.

- More multiplayer modes and tools like competitively building machines are planned for future release.

- Machines and levels are stored as JSON files under your Documents folder:

  - ~/Documents/Turing Sandbox Saves/


- Supports automatic saving of workshop downloads and local creations.

- Saved machines can be reopened or shared across devices.

- Level progress is also saved using json

## üåê Workshop

- Browse and download machines or levels created by other users.

- Rate creations or upload your own.

- Requires login (handled through the in-game authentication popup).

## üßÆ Double Tape Support

- Advanced levels and sandbox setups can use two tapes for more complex machines.

- Each transition supports independent read/write/move operations per tape.

## Discord Rich Presence
